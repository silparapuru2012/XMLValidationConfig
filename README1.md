# System Design Document

## Overview

Our app delivers robust SOAP services seamlessly as Windows services, orchestrated by Spring Boot and powered by the efficient Apache CXF JAX-WS framework. With the read-only service benefiting from Elasticache's caching prowess and Actuator endpoints providing a watchful eye over the system's health, this design promises reliability and performance.

# System Design Document

## Overview

The system is designed to provide transactional and read-only SOAP services using Spring Boot as a Windows service. Apache CXF JAX-WS is utilized for SOAP service implementation, and Elasticache is employed for caching in the read-only service. Additionally, the system integrates Actuator endpoints for monitoring and management and implements logging with separate application and service logs.

## Architecture

The architecture follows a layered approach, incorporating various components and patterns for robustness and scalability.

### Layers

1. **Presentation Layer:**
   - Responsible for handling client requests and delivering responses.
   - Utilizes Apache CXF JAX-WS for SOAP service implementation.

2. **Service Layer:**
   - Implements business logic and orchestrates data access.
   - Contains transactional and read-only services.

3. **Data Access Layer:**
   - Manages interaction with the database.
   - Utilizes Spring Data or custom DAOs for data access.

4. **Integration Layer:**
   - Facilitates integration with external systems or services.
   - May include third-party APIs, messaging systems, etc.

### Components and Interfaces

1. **Spring Boot Application:**
   - Acts as the core runtime environment for the services, providing configuration, dependency management, and lifecycle management.
   - Utilizes embedded servers (like Tomcat, Jetty) for deploying web services.
   - Facilitates easy integration with various Spring projects and third-party libraries.

2. **Apache CXF:**
   - Implements SOAP service endpoints and client support.
   - Offers annotations such as `@WebService` for defining web services and `@WebMethod` for specifying service operations.
   - Supports various SOAP features including WS-Security, WS-Addressing, and MTOM.

3. **Elasticache:**
   - A fully managed in-memory data store provided by AWS.
   - Supports popular caching engines like Redis and Memcached.
   - Provides high performance and scalability for caching frequently accessed data, reducing database load and improving response times.

4. **Actuator Endpoints:**
   - Exposes various HTTP endpoints for monitoring and managing the application at runtime.
   - Includes endpoints like `/health`, `/info`, `/metrics`, and `/env` for health checks, application information, metrics, and environment properties.
   - Enables integration with monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Spring Boot Admin.

5. **SOAP Interface:**
   - Defines the contract for SOAP-based communication between clients and services.
   - Utilizes WSDL (Web Services Description Language) to describe the service interface, operations, and message formats.
   - Allows for platform-independent communication between heterogeneous systems.

6. **Cache Interface:**
   - Provides a standardized interface for interacting with the caching layer.
   - Includes methods for caching and retrieving data, as well as cache eviction strategies and data loading mechanisms.
   - Abstracts the underlying caching implementation, allowing for easy switching between different caching providers.

### Key Patterns and Design Patterns

1. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):**
   - Decomposes the system into loosely coupled and independently deployable services.
   - Promotes reusability, scalability, and flexibility by encapsulating business logic into autonomous units of functionality.

2. **Dependency Injection (DI):**
   - Inversion of control (IoC) pattern used by Spring Boot for managing component dependencies.
   - Reduces coupling between components, making the system more modular and easier to maintain.
   - Enhances testability by allowing dependencies to be easily mocked or stubbed during unit testing.

3. **Repository Pattern:**
   - Abstracts data access logic into repositories, providing a uniform interface for accessing data from various data sources.
   - Improves maintainability and testability by decoupling the application logic from the underlying data access mechanism.
   - Supports features like pagination, sorting, and querying, making it easier to work with large datasets.

4. **Caching Pattern:**
   - Utilized in the read-only service to cache frequently accessed data.
   - Reduces database load and improves response times by storing data in memory.
   - Strategies like read-through or write-through caching can be implemented based on application requirements.

5. **Singleton Pattern:**
   - Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
   - Used by Spring Boot to manage singleton beans within the application context.
   - Useful for managing shared resources, configuration settings, and caching mechanisms.

6. **Builder Pattern:**
   - Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
   - Often used for configuring beans in Spring Boot applications, especially when dealing with complex or nested configuration settings.
   - Enhances readability and maintainability by providing a clear and fluent API for building objects.

7. **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) Pattern:**
   - Separates cross-cutting concerns (such as logging, security, and transaction management) from the core business logic.
   - Allows these concerns to be applied selectively across different components or methods in the application.
   - Implemented in Spring Boot using AOP proxies and pointcut expressions, providing a flexible mechanism for intercepting method invocations.

8. **Decorator Pattern:**
   - Used for dynamically adding additional behavior to objects.
   - Implemented in the read-only service for adding caching functionality to service methods.
   - Allows for transparently enhancing the behavior of methods without modifying their original implementation.

### Implementation Details

1. **Windows Service Configuration:**
   - Services are configured to run as Windows services using Spring Boot's service wrapper.
   - Configuration settings, including service name, description, and startup behavior, are specified in the service configuration file (`application.properties` or `application.yml`).

2. **SOAP Service Implementation:**
   - Apache CXF annotations (`@WebService`, `@WebMethod`, etc.) are used to define SOAP service endpoints and operations.
   - Interceptors may be configured to handle cross-cutting concerns such as logging, security, and performance monitoring.

3. **Elasticache Integration:**
   - The Elasticache client library for Java is used to interact with the caching layer.
   - Caching strategies such as read-through or write-through caching may be implemented based on the application requirements.

4. **Actuator Endpoints Integration:**
   - The Actuator dependency is included in the Spring Boot project to enable monitoring and management capabilities.
   - Actuator endpoints are exposed and configured to provide insights into the application's health, metrics, and environment properties.

5. **Logging Configuration:**
   - Logging configuration is managed via `application.properties` or `application.yml`, allowing fine-tuning of logging levels, appenders, and formatting.
   - Separate appenders are configured for application and service logs, with custom log patterns to capture relevant information.
